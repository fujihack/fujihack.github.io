<p>Since AI generated art has made photography obsolete, FujiHack has
decided to refocus its efforts to a new niche: Gaming.</p>
<p>I present to you, <a
href="https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric/">DOOM</a> running on the
Fujifilm X-A2. This was not an easy feat, it took days of debugging bare
metal ARM assembly, not to mention the past year of reverse engineering
leading to this point.</p>

<p>After a few days of internal testing, we determined that the buttons
were not ideal for Doom gameplay and gave users cramps. After careful
review, we have chosen to expand our efforts to <a
href="https://github.com/dogecoinfoundation/libdogecoin/">Dogecoin
mining</a> in the next few months.</p>
<hr />
<p>Okay, now that April 1st is over, is it real?<br />
Yes, it’s real, and I’ve even provided <a
href="https://github.com/fujihack/fujihack/releases/tag/0.2.0">instructions
on how to run this on a Fujifilm X-A2</a>.</p>
<p>A DOOM port was inevitable, as I needed a way to test the stability
of the Fujihack codebase. DOOM helped test almost all of it, especially
IO operations (fopen, fseek, fread, screen drawing, button reading,
timing, memory allocation, etc)</p>
<p>Now that we know it’s possible to run complex software on these
cameras, I’m working on getting these hacks running <em>without</em>
firmware mods, so they can be run safely by anybody.</p>
