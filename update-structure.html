		<p class="big">Update on Fujihack Project Structure</p>
		
		March 3rd, 2023

		<p>For the past year and a half, Fujihack has been a solely a research project, with little useful features.
		I'm planning on changing this in the coming months with some significant changes to the project's structure:
		
		<ul>
		<li>The <a href="https://github.com/fujihack/fujihack">main Fujihack repository</a> will serve mostly as a kernel (or more accurately, a POSIX abstraction layer over Fujifilm's kernel)</li>
		<li>The repository will not have any menus or apps, these will be provided by another repository</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/34qbxzeRdKg">Actually useful features</a> will be implemented as 'apps', which will be run similarly to Magic Lantern modules</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		
		The menus, UI library, linker, app system, and scripting engine will be provided by a separate project I'm working on, called <a href="https://github.com/petabyt/frontier">Frontier</a>.
		<br><br>
		Frontier is a Utility Operating System that will allow camera hacks to be easier to develop, test, and debug. Fujihack will use most of the code
		in Fujihack minus the POSIX compatible kernel, which will be provided by fujihack.
		<br>
		Frontier will be usable both on Fujifilm cameras, a custom emulator, and possibly other devices in the future. Being able to run the system on multiple
		devices will not only make development less painful, but should ensure better stability and safety.
