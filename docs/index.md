# FujiHack
FujiHack is a free and open-source firmware patch for Fujifilm X/GFX/HS/F/Z cameras.

**Currently FujiHack is not stable and *shouldn't* be run on production cameras.**

FujiHack will only work on a very specific RTOS and firmware type. You can put your  
firmware file into the [web patcher](https://fujihack.github.io/patcher/) to see if FujiHack supports your firmware type.  
In general, FujiHack does NOT support the XP and S series Fujifilm cameras,  
and anything older than 2005.
