# FujiHack
FujiHack is a free and open-source software that can be run on Fujifilm X/GFX/HS/F/Z/Pro cameras.

**Currently FujiHack is not stable and *shouldn't* be run on production cameras. FujiHack is currently a research project, and the only way to run it is with patched firmware.**

FujiHack is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/fujihack/fujihack).

FujiHack will only work on a very specific RTOS and firmware type. You can put your firmware file into the [web patcher](https://fujihack.github.io/patcher/) to see if FujiHack supports your firmware type.  

In general, FujiHack does NOT support the XP and S series Fujifilm cameras.
