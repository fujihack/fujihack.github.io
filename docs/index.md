## What cameras does it support?
FujiHack will only work on a very specific RTOS and firmware type. You can put your firmware file into the [web patcher](https://fujihack.github.io/patcher/) to see if FujiHack supports your firmware type.  

In general, FujiHack does NOT support the XP and S series Fujifilm cameras. The S Series has already been [hacked by CHDK forum members](https://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=6484.0).
