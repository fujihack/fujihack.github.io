# Sponsor Development
Unlike some other projects of mine, I've decided that this one won't be a money pit for me.  
The project will be funded entirely by donors.

Money donated to the project will help pay for development tools, domains, and cameras.
Currently I'm saving for a cheap camera as my current dev camera is [a destroyed XF1](https://danielc.dev/blog/fujifilm-xf1-teardown) that can't take pictures
