# Sponsor Development
Unlike some other projects of mine, I've decided that this one won't be a money pit for me.
The project will be funded entirely by donors. This is meant primarily to prevent me from obsessing too much over the project.  

Money donated to the project will help pay for cameras, tools, and a .org domain.

Read about the project first and then decide if it's worth your money.
