## Low Hanging Fruit
Things needed as of September 2023

- Improve [patcher](https://github.com/fujihack/patcher) HTML/CSS
- Make patcher use JS Classes instead of JSON Objects
- Write an emulator for Fuji emulator - everything is there in the firmware file - just need to map out the I/O
- Motherboard screenshots
- Test a custom firmware
- Index and data-hoard all Fujifilm firmware files
